In order to start the file, please refer to the 'How to install expo' documentation for more specific details.
https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.24/getting-started

Here are the instructions that our team members followed in order to simulate the app through expo.


1. Have nodejs installed (i needed a version 13.x.x so you might wanna google an installation for yourself)
2. Install expo globall onto your computer
3. Clone the repository onto your local drive and open up the project folder with the IDE of your choice. (Works smoothly with VScode for us)

Once those files have been downloaded the commands in the terminal of your IDE of project root folder:
1. 'expo install' -> Install expo into the project on your local drive
2. 'npm install' -> Download all necessary dependencies

* Now Download Expo Client on your mobile device via the app store*

3. 'expo start' -> Which launches a QR code in the IDE's terminal. Scan it with the camera app on your phone to launch the simulator in expo client. 

A test account which you can use is
username: test@test.com 
password: 123456

However you can also create your own account to navigate through the app
